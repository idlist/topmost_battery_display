# Topmost Battery Display

A mini Flutter app to have a topmost battery display.

## Why this?

The story is that the battery of my laptop (even with the power cable plugged) is still drained when running heavy things, especially when playing video games. On the other hand, in these scenario the application is usually (borderless) fullscreened and I can't see the battery icon in the taskbar. So I decided to make this floating display.
