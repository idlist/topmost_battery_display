## Available Platform

Windows.

## Why This?

The story is that the battery of my laptop (even with the power cable plugged) is still drained when running heavy things, especially when playing video games.

In these scenarios, the taskbar is usually hidden and and I can't see the battery icon in it. As a result, I decided to develop a battery display by myself.
