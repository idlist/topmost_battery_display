# Topmost Battery Display

A mini Flutter app to have a topmost battery display.

## Available platform

Windows

## Why this?

The story is that the battery of my laptop (even with the power cable plugged) is still drained when running heavy things, especially when playing video games.

And in these scenarios, the taskbar is usually hidden and and I can't see the battery icon in it.
